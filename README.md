## Generic Launcher

A (currently not finished/barely started) implementation of a generic applications launcher in Rust.
It uses the GTK layer shell protocol.

Currently is just a window that will hide and unhide when the program is called.

The idea is to bind it to the windows key and use it as an applications launcher/control-center-panel-type thing.
